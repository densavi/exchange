We are required by Law to ask you to provide your name, address, date of birth and other information about you, your organisation or persons related to your organisation that will allow us to identify you before we approve your Account. We also may ask you to provide certain identifying documents, such as your driver&rsquo;s license or passport or your organisation&rsquo;s articles of incorporation and may obtain credit and other consumer reports to assist us in verifying your identity and in determining whether you satisfy our account criteria. Unless you provide the requested information and documentation, we may not be able to open your Account.</p><p>By applying for an {SERVER_NAME} Account, you agree to provide the information and documentation requested by {SERVER_NAME} and consent to {SERVER_NAME}&rsquo;s acquisition of credit and other consumer reports about you for the purposes described above.</p><p>The {SERVER_NAME}&rsquo;s Customer due diligence (&ldquo;<strong>CDD</strong>&ldquo;) procedure requires the Users to provide {SERVER_NAME} with reliable, independent source documents to identify them and confirm their residential address. Such documents may include, for example, a national ID card, an international passport, a bank statement, a utility bill. For such purposes, {SERVER_NAME} reserves the right to collect the Users&rsquo; identification information for the purposes of compliance with its AML/CFT and KYC Policy.</p><p>{SERVER_NAME} will take steps to confirm the authenticity of documents and information provided by Users. {SERVER_NAME} will also look to verify identification information through secondary sources, and {SERVER_NAME} reserves the right to investigate further the cases of Users where {SERVER_NAME} is not satisfied with the documentation submitted.</p><p>{SERVER_NAME} reserves the right to verify the identity of the User on an ongoing basis, especially when its identification information has been changed or its activities appear suspicious (unusual for a particular User). In addition, {SERVER_NAME} reserves the right to request from the Users current documents, even if they have been authenticated in the past.</p><p>Information about the user&rsquo;s identification will be collected, stored, shared and protected strictly in accordance with the {SERVER_NAME}&rsquo;s&nbsp;Privacy Policy&nbsp;and relevant rules. The User agrees that if any information provided in the Account application changes, ceases to be true or becomes materially misleading (including, but not limited to, the ownership of the Account) then the User will notify {SERVER_NAME} of the changes.</p><p>After confirming the identity of the user, {SERVER_NAME} may refuse to provide Services to the User if {SERVER_NAME}&rsquo;s Services are suspected to be used for the purposes of conducting illegal activities.</p><p>{SERVER_NAME} has a regulatory requirement to verify the sources of Fiat Money and/or Cryptocurrency to know that the sources of the Funds that Users use to trade with are legitimate. {SERVER_NAME} will require evidence of the source of Funds; this may include bank statements for Fiat Money or a video showing wallet transaction details for Cryptocurrency.</p><p>Users who intend to use payment cards for the purpose of consuming Services must undergo a card check in accordance with the instructions available on the {SERVER_NAME}&rsquo;s Site.</p><p>{SERVER_NAME} uses independent third-party companies for the following:</p><ul><li>check Users against Politically Exposed Person&rsquo;s (PEP) and Sanctions Lists as well as checks for Adverse Media.</li><li>assess User&rsquo;s cryptocurrency wallets with regards to AML investigation and compliance.</li></ul><p>{SERVER_NAME} reserves the right to terminate or refuse Accounts on the basis of information attained by the third-party companies this includes Users connected to &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; wallets.</p><p><strong>Chief Compliance Officer</strong></p><p>The Chief Compliance Officer is the person, duly authorised by {SERVER_NAME}, whose duty is to ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of the AML/CFT and KYC Policy. It is the Chief Compliance Officer&rsquo;s responsibility to supervise all aspects of {SERVER_NAME}&rsquo;s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing procedures, in particular:</p><ul><li>collection of Users&rsquo; identification information;</li><li>establishing and updating internal policies and procedures for the completion, review, submission and retention of all reports and records required under the applicable laws and regulations;</li><li>monitoring transactions and investigating any significant deviations from normal activity;</li><li>implementing a records management system for appropriate storage and retrieval of documents, files, forms and logs, updating risk assessment regularly, providing law enforcement with information as required under the applicable laws and regulations.</li></ul><p>The Chief Compliance Officer is the contact point for {SERVER_NAME} with law enforcement agencies for the purposes of prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal activities.</p><p><strong>Transaction Monitoring</strong></p><p>{SERVER_NAME} Users must complete the {SERVER_NAME}&rsquo;s identity verification process (who you are) before trading.

A risk-based approach is taken to identify Users and monitor how they use our Services.</p><p>The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for managing financial crime risks and making improvements in financial crime risk management through identifying the general and specific money laundering risks that {SERVER_NAME} is facing, determining how these risks are mitigated by the {SERVER_NAME}&rsquo;s AML controls and establishing the residual risk that remains for {SERVER_NAME}.</p><p><strong>Country of Residence</strong></p><p>{SERVER_NAME}&rsquo;s AML and KYC Policy sets out {SERVER_NAME}&rsquo;s risk appetite with regard to AML/KYC. To reduce this risk {SERVER_NAME} does not accept clients who are resident in countries deemed to be above the {SERVER_NAME}&rsquo;s risk appetite.</p><p>The sources used with regards to the categorisation were:</p><ul><li>Transparency International;</li><li>Know Your Country;</li><li>FATF High Risk Jurisdictions;</li><li>EU High Risk Jurisdictions;</li><li>Countries where Digital Assets are prohibited or there are restrictions on trading;</li><li>Countries where Digital Assets are not prohibited;</li><li>Countries subject to UNSC Sanctions Regime.</li></ul><p>It must me clear that {SERVER_NAME}&rsquo;s policy is that&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;clients resident in the below countries are banned and cannot be accepted as a client.
